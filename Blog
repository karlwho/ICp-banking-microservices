Digital Transformation is Key to Growth

According to a recent Forrester report for Infrastructure & Operations Professionals: “In 2017, 66% of our survey respondents claim to have adopted private cloud, with another 16% planning to adopt it in the next 12 months. What's even more noteworthy is the increase in quality: 51% of respondents have enabled self-service, resource tracking, and policy-based automation with their private cloud technology to obtain a true cloud, up from 35% the year before. While many of these still fall short on the cloud litmus test, enterprises are getting closer to the bar.”
The adoption of private cloud at such massive growth rate in such a short time is unprecedented. 
Among the key motivating factors:

Security – Recent hacking headlines and Security compliance regulations are making very difficult for some business to securely continue deploying their core applications on the public cloud.
Sustainable Innovation – Growing ecosystem to include hybrid cloud. APIs to allow connectivity to newer and cloud-native applications.
Vendor locking -  Open source tools are the essence of technical innovation in the IT industry. From no cost software trials, to large user communities and readily available talents, open source software has established a credible platform recognized as the fuel for innovation.         
DevOps – Businesses are providing readily available middleware and middleware services on private cloud. IBM Cloud private (ICp) has moved WebSphere, message queue, DB2 and the data science experience in containerized versions. 

Private cloud combines the advantages of hosting and cloud, including cost savings, customization, and rapid enablement.
